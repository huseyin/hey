`hey` is a tiny program that provides a simple CLI interface to perform HTTP load testing on your services. It's originally created by [rakyll](https://github.com/rakyll), this repository is a fork intended to add a few additional features, which may slightly alter the original behavior, so if you prefer to use the original version (last compiled a long time ago), please refer to the original repository.

Please note that this is currently WIP and may not be working as expected.
